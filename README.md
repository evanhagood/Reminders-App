# Reminders-App
This app is a way to teach myself Git and also SQL as a backend for a simple reminders app. I will be using Python for the front end and SQLite for the backend.

 -- After 30 minutes of permission errors trying to push to this repo on Github, I finally got it working. Turns out that I had old credentials on my PC from another account which did not have access to this repository.
 -- Decided to ditch JavaFX in favor of teaching myself Python because I do not want to have to deal with the runtime components again. I swear my pain will never end.
